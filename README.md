# The ClaimMaker

This repository contains a frivolous programming exercise meant to celebrate Randall Munroe's iconic xkcd webcomic. In the comic #1930, "Calendar Facts", Munroe lays out an excellent flowchart for generating calendar-related claims. Though entirely fictitious, the claims mostly have a distinct ring of plausibility.

The flowchart is quite enterataining to eyeball as it is. Yet it can be quite tedious to build up whole claims following it manually. The Python code in this repository automates this process: it generates novel claims about our calendar system by randomly following Munroe's flowchart.
