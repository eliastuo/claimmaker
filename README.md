# The ClaimMaker

This repository contains a frivolous programming exercise meant to celebrate Randall Munroe's iconic xkcd webcomic. In the comic #1930, "[Calendar Facts](https://xkcd.com/1930/ "Calendar Facts")", Munroe lays out an excellent flowchart for generating calendar-related claims. Though entirely fictitious, the claims mostly have a distinct ring of plausibility.

The flowchart is quite enterataining to eyeball as it is. Yet it can be quite tedious to build up whole claims following it manually. The Python code in this repository automates the process: it generates novel claims about our calendar system by randomly following Munroe's flowchart.

## Example Claims

Did you know that the earliest sunrise drifts out of sync with the Moon because of obliquity of the Mason-Dixon line? Apparently it was even more extreme during the Bronze Age. While it may seem like trivia, it causes huge headaches for software developers.

Did you know that daylight saving time might not happen this year because of a decree by the pope in the 1500s? Apparently it causes a predictable increase in car accidents. While it may seem like trivia, it is taken advantage of by high-speed traders.

Did you know that Toyota Truck Month might happen twice this year because of magnetic field reversal? Apparently it's getting worse and no one knows why. While it may seem like trivia, it triggered the 2003 Northeast Blackout.
